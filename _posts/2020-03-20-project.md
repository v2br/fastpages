Abstract

<p>
	
## Introduction
<p>

Many hospital patients are readmitted within 30 days after discharge. Often it indicates problems with the quality of hospital care. Recently this parameter became part of the National Hospital Evaluation metric. 
In 2014 researches of Virginia Commonwealth University used resources of Health Facts database from Center corp (major medical data hub)  and NIH grant to assemble the dataset to study readmissions especially for diabetic patients. They wanted to analyze if proper management of blood level sugar will affect readmission. 

This study focussed on predcitors for term readmission (readmission in less than 30 days) for this type of patients. The result could be a useful base for deeper analysis by health care experts and machine learning specialists. 

The dataset consists of  50 features and 110 observations. Each observation is one patient hospitalization record with a readmission parameter.

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above:

	<div class="img_row">
	  <img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
	  <img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
	</div>
